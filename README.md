# Rank It Up

Hello githubber! This repo contains the code I used to build the client side of my first fullstack application, Rank It Up: A Standings Generator. Rank It Up allows users to create players or teams. Once a player or team is created, users are able to face them off against each other in a match. Within a match, they will determine the outcome and choose a winner, loser, or decide if it's a draw. The application will keep record of each player's or team's wins and losses to make a standing table. This table will rank the player or team! Do you need to Rank It Up?!

## Wireframes and User Stories

A wireframe is an image that sketches out the layout of major pieces of content within a page, without all of the fully-rendered detail that might be present in an illustration.

My wireframe is a basic layout of what I planned on making my site look. Check them out:
